# Introduction

Dirble is a website directory scanning tool for Windows and Linux. It's designed to be fast to run and easy to use.

# How to Use

Download one of the precompiled binaries for your system, then run it from a terminal. By default Dirble looks for a dirble_wordlist.txt in the directory it is run from.

# Example Uses

Run against a website using the default dirble_wordlist.txt from the current directory:
`dirble [address]`

Run with a different wordlist and including .php and .html extensions:
`dirble [address] -w example_wordlist.txt -X .php,.html`

With listable directory scraping enabled:
`dirble [address] --scrape-listable`

# Building from source

To build on your current platform, ensure cargo is installed and then run `cargo build --release`. Alternatively, running `make` will build the binary in release mode (internally running `cargo build --release`).

To cross-compile for 32- and 64-bit Linux and Windows targets, there is a handy makefile. `make release` will build for all four targets using `cross`. This depends on having cross and docker installed (`cargo install cross`).

# Performance

The following graph was generated by running each tool with Hyperfine against a test server with 5ms latency and 1% packet loss. (Gobuster was omitted due to lack of recursion).
